def roadsBuilding(cities, roads):
    complete = set([])
    for m in range(cities):
        for n in range(m+1, cities):
            complete.add((m, n))
    for [s, t] in roads:
        if s > t:
            s, t = t, s
        complete.remove((s, t))
    out = list(complete)
    out.sort()
    return out

complete is a set of 2-tuples, yet out is a list or 2-element lists?
Why is that?
