1. The person with the max number of pancakes is our limiting factor.
2. This person can (and will) change when we move pancakes around,
   Google knows this and will have test cases that our tricky in that
   way.
3. If we should move pancakes from one person to another,
  we should always move half of the pancakes.
4. If we should move pancakes, we should do so ASAP.
5. Adding pancakes to the plate of someone who already has pancakes,
   is never a better idea than giving them to the pancakeless.
6. If the difference between the first n and the next is >(n+1),
    then split and recurse. (!!!)
