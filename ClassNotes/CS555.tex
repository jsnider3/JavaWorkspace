\begin{itemize}
\item What are the seven layers? (This was a midterm question, possibly also on the final)
\begin{itemize}
\item Application
\item Presentation
\item Session
\item Transport
\item Network
\item DLC
\item Physical
\end{itemize}
\item Types of switching
\begin{enumerate}
\item Message switching - entire message is sent as one giant block, sent from host to host to host. Kind of stupid.
\item Packet switching - each packet in the message is sent individually, real-time, reliable, prioritization
\item Circuit switching - dedicated circuit is created between beginning and end, phones.
\item Leased lines - permanently dedicated circuit, heavy constant traffic. See Spread Networks.
\end{enumerate}
\item Network functions
\begin{itemize}
\item Addressing - mapping names to addresses. translation done by nameservers.
\item Routing - selecting path for messages to take.
\item Congestion control
\end{itemize}
\item Types of Routing
\begin{enumerate}
\item Connection-oriented - establish a virtual circuit and send all data over it. Guarantees packets arrive in-order.
\item Connectionless - Like IP, each packet is routed seperately as datagrams. Has some issues that need to be handled.
\item Source routing - done as homework, not practical because it assumes everyone knows everything
\end{enumerate}
\item Ways to control congestion
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tell hosts to shut up.
\item Allocate more buffers.
\item Drop packets (connectionless only)
\item Require use of sliding window (connection-oriented only)
\item Reroute packets around congestion as if they were cars in traffic (connectionless only)
\end{enumerate}
\item Internetworking
\end{itemize}
