This is a simple tool for calculating the odds and results of
dice in the new World of Darkness. There are alot of special dice
rules in New World of Darkness, but for regular dice the basics
are that you roll a number of d10's, everything that shows a 8, 9,
or 10 is a "success" and you reroll those above a certain level
(usually only 10s) in order to try to get more successes.

Other tricky rules are ones where you don't roll 10s again, but you
lose a success for every 1 that shows up and the "rote" special where
every failure on your first roll is rerolled and then rerolls proceed
as normal.

# How To Run
Build it with javac DiceRollerImproved.java 
and run it with java DiceRollerImproved. Type in the number of
dice you want to roll and what the roll again cutoff is and then 
either click roll or calculate.
