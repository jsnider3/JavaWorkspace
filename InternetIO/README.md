## InternetIO

This is old Java code. All of it has something to do with the web.
Most of it is to download webcomics as images so that I could read
through them offline. The Joseph McCabe getter is similar, but for
downloading books/essays he wrote. Much of it is in a half done state
and its likely that the webcomics have changed there format in a way
to break the ones that were once functional.
